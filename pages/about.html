        <h1>About taco guy/Jose/!</h1>
<p> My name is taco guy, from the name you can see that i enjoy to eat tacos! My favorite sport is eating, my favorite hobby is eating and my favorite thing to do in the world is eating. All joking aside I am a photographer, I have a huge passion for taking pictures about everything,coding, and cooking. I am also have a youtube channel. My youtube channel is friedchicken president but i will change it to Jose or something that is not such a silly name. I tend to be reading or watching Youtube videos when I have time. </p>
   <h2>Why do I have a passion for  photography</h2>
   <p>I have a passion for phototgraphy because when I was in eight grade I had a photography class. I was the only student that took good pictures and because of photography I got to travel to places where I wouldn't and meet all of my friends. I took a picture of overything so it can bring memories. What I realized is that every picture is good no matter how "bad" it looks. One day I took a picture of the tacos that I made and the Mcdonald's mascot. I thought these pictures were the worst only to find out that I would get $150 for each of those pictuers. Here is a link to my Youtube channel  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/william28908">Jose's Youtube channel.</a> </p>
